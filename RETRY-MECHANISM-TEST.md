# Retry Mechanism Testing Guide

## Overview
The retry mechanism has been successfully implemented for failed chat queries. This document provides testing instructions.

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Added

1. **CSS Styles** (lines 552-588 in index.html)
   - `.retry-button` - Main retry button styling with red border/text
   - `.error-message` - Error message styling in red italic text
   - Hover effects and disabled states

2. **Retry Function** (lines 1009-1041 in index.html)
   - `retryMessage(button)` - Handles retry logic
   - Extracts original question from data attribute
   - Removes failed message and resends query
   - Shows loading state during retry

3. **Error Handling Enhancement** (lines 1186-1212 in index.html)
   - Stores original question in `data-original-question` attribute
   - Displays contextual error messages based on error type
   - Shows retry button with circular arrow icon
   - Handles different error scenarios:
     - Network/connection failures
     - Rate limiting (429)
     - Server errors (500)
     - Generic errors

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Simulated Network Failure

**Method 1: Using Browser DevTools**
1. Open the application in browser
2. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Click "Offline" to simulate network disconnection
5. Type a question and send
6. You should see error message with retry button
7. Click "Online" in DevTools
8. Click the "Retry" button
9. The query should succeed

**Method 2: Disable Server**
1. Stop the FastAPI backend server
2. Send a query in the chat
3. Error message should appear with retry button
4. Restart the server
5. Click "Retry" button
6. Query should succeed

### Test 2: Visual Verification

**Expected UI Elements:**
- Error message in red italic text
- Retry button with:
  - Red border and text (default state)
  - Red background with white text (hover)
  - Circular arrow icon
  - "Retry" text label
  - Opacity 0.5 when disabled

### Test 3: Retry Functionality

**Steps:**
1. Trigger a failure (using methods above)
2. Observe error message appears
3. Click retry button
4. Button should show:
   - "Retrying..." text
   - Disabled state
   - Spinning arrow icon
5. Failed message should be removed
6. New response should appear (or new error if still failing)

### Test 4: Multiple Retries

**Steps:**
1. Trigger failure
2. Keep server/network offline
3. Click retry
4. Should fail again with new error message and retry button
5. Can retry multiple times
6. Each retry removes previous failed message

## Error Messages by Scenario

| Scenario | Error Message |
|----------|---------------|
| Network disconnected | "Connection failed. Please check your internet connection." |
| Rate limited (429) | "Too many requests. Please wait a moment before retrying." |
| Server error (500) | "Server error occurred. Please try again." |
| Other errors | "Just a moment — things seem a bit slow right now. Please try again shortly." |

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. User sends query
2. `sendMessage()` stores question in `botDiv.dataset.originalQuestion`
3. If error occurs, retry button is rendered
4. User clicks retry button
5. `retryMessage()` retrieves question from dataset
6. Original failed message is removed
7. Question is set in input field and `sendMessage()` is called again

### Key Features
- ✅ Retry button only appears on failed messages
- ✅ Original user message remains visible for context
- ✅ Failed messages are replaced, not duplicated
- ✅ Retry button is disabled during retry to prevent double-clicks
- ✅ No automatic retry (user must click)
- ✅ Contextual error messages based on error type

## Verification Checklist

## Status
