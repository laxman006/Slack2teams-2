Q: What are the frequent conflicts faced during Migration?
A: Bad request (Non Retriable):
- Replied message version conflicts in post
- We don't migrate bot messages
- Missing body content
- Neither body nor adaptive card content contains marker for mention with Id

Resource Modifies (Retryable):
- Resource has changed - usually an eTag mismatch
- Omitting partial - files size varies but data migrate without any data missing

Q: Do we migrate app integration messages?
A: No, we don't migrate app integration messages, but they will appear as admin posted messages.

Q: Do we migrate slack channels into existing teams?
A: Yes, we do migrate Slack channels into existing Teams. But those messages inside a channel will be migrated as admin posted messages.

Q: How to migrate deactivated user DMS?
A: We can't migrate deactivated user DMs because deactivated users can't authenticate from Teams. It's a limitation of Teams.

Q: Do we migrate the link to other messages from Slack?
A: No, we don't migrate. They will be migrated as links, but those links will redirect back to Slack.
