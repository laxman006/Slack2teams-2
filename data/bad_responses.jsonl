This allows you to identify the specific issues that caused the failure.\n\n2. **Post-Migration Validation**: After the migration, we conduct a complete validation of the content, permissions, and other metadata. This helps in identifying any discrepancies or data that may not have migrated correctly.\n\n3. **Support from Migration Experts**: Our dedicated migration team is available to assist you in troubleshooting and resolving any issues that arise during the migration process. They can provide guidance on how to rectify the problems and ensure a successful migration.\n\n4. **Delta Migrations**: If the initial migration fails, you can utilize delta migrations to transfer only the new or updated data after the first attempt. This ensures that any changes made during the migration process are captured without needing to redo the entire migration.\n\n5. **Pre-Migration Assessments**: To minimize the chances of failure, we conduct pre-migration assessments to identify potential risks and issues before the migration begins.\n\n6. **End-to-End Support**: Our managed migration service includes support throughout the entire migration journey, ensuring that any issues can be promptly addressed.\n\nIf you encounter a migration failure or have specific concerns about your migration project, please reach out to our team for assistance [here](https://www.cloudfuze.com/contact/). We're here to help you navigate any challenges you may face!","metadata":{"endpoint":"/chat/stream","conversational_query":"false","streaming":"true","timestamp":"2025-10-27T10:28:38.138237"},"Contextcorrectness":null,"User Feedback":["ðŸ‘Ž Bad"],"auto_correction":null,"user_rating":null}
