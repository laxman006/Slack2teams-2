    "question": "How does delta migration work in CloudFuze?",
    "category": "Migration - Detailed Explanation",
    "answer": "Delta migration in CloudFuze is designed to ensure that data remains up-to-date during the migration process, allowing users to continue working on their source cloud while changes are being migrated. Here’s how it works:\n\n### Overview of Delta Migration\n- **Incremental Changes**: Delta migration, also known as incremental migration, occurs after the initial one-time migration is completed. It focuses on migrating only the updates and changes made to the source cloud during the period following the one-time migration.\n- **Types of Changes Migrated**: This includes new files added, modifications made, or deletions of existing files in the source cloud.\n\n### Process of Delta Migration\n1. **Initial Migration**: The process begins with a one-time migration where all data is transferred from the source cloud to the destination cloud.\n2. **Scheduling Delta Migration**: After the one-time migration, CloudFuze schedules the delta migration, typically on weekends, to minimize disruption to users.\n3. **Migration of Updates**: During delta migration, only the changes that occurred in the source cloud since the last migration are transferred. This makes delta migration faster and more efficient compared to the initial migration, as it does not involve moving the entire dataset again.\n\n### Benefits of Delta Migration\n- **Zero Downtime**: Users can continue to work on their files in the source cloud without experiencing downtime during the migration process.\n- **Time Efficiency**: Since only updates are migrated, delta migration usually takes considerably less time than the one-time migration.\n- **Cost-Effective**: Delta migration is included as a core feature for all CloudFuze customers, making it a cost-effective solution for businesses.\n\n### Conclusion\nCloudFuze’s delta migration feature is essential for ensuring that all incremental changes are captured and migrated, allowing businesses to maintain data integrity and continuity during the transition to a new cloud environment. For more detailed information, you can read the full blog post on [Delta Migration](https://www.cloudfuze.com/delta-migration-how-cloudfuze-ensures-zero-downtime-during-migration/). \n\nIf you have specific migration needs or questions, feel free to [contact CloudFuze](https://www.cloudfuze.com/contact/) for assistance!",

    "question": "What happens to file version history during Box to OneDrive migration?",
    "category": "Migration - Detailed Explanation",
    "answer": "During the migration from Box to OneDrive, preserving file version history is crucial for maintaining data integrity and compliance. CloudFuze's migration tool is designed to handle this effectively by allowing businesses to migrate either all versions or selective versions of files.\n\nHere are the key points regarding file version history during the migration:\n\n- **Version History Preservation**: CloudFuze can migrate all versions of a file from Box to OneDrive, ensuring that the complete version history is retained. This is essential for tracking changes, restoring previous versions, and meeting compliance requirements.\n\n- **Selective Version Migration**: Users have the option to choose how many versions to migrate—whether to transfer all versions or a specific number (e.g., the latest 5, 10, or 20 versions). This flexibility helps manage storage space and migration costs effectively.\n\n- **Impact on Storage**: It's important to note that migrating file versions can double the storage space required in OneDrive. For example, if a file has multiple versions, the total size in OneDrive will increase accordingly, which may lead to additional costs.\n\n- **Challenges with Native Tools**: There are no native Microsoft options for maintaining version history when migrating from Box to OneDrive. Manual methods or basic sync tools often result in loss of metadata, including version history.\n\nBy using CloudFuze, organizations can ensure that their file version histories are preserved during the migration process, thus avoiding potential operational disruptions and compliance issues. For more detailed information, you can refer to the [Box to OneDrive Migration Guide for IT Admins](https://www.cloudfuze.com/how-to-transfer-files-from-box-to-onedrive/). \n\nIf you have further questions or need assistance, feel free to [contact CloudFuze](https://www.cloudfuze.com/contact/).",
