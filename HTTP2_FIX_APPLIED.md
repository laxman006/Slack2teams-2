# HTTP/2 Stream Fix Applied ✅

## What Was Fixed

Fixed `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` that was preventing chat responses from displaying on screen.

## Changes Made

### 1. nginx.conf
- ✅ Changed `chunked_transfer_encoding` from `off` to `on`
- ✅ Added `X-Accel-Buffering: no` header (critical for HTTP/2)
- ✅ Added `proxy_request_buffering off`
- ✅ Fixed Connection header to `keep-alive`
- ✅ Added CORS headers
- ✅ Added OPTIONS preflight handling

### 2. app/endpoints.py
- ✅ Added 50ms delay before stream closure (4 locations)
- ✅ Added `X-Accel-Buffering: no` to response headers
- ✅ Added CORS headers to StreamingResponse
- ✅ Ensures proper HTTP/2 stream termination

## Deployment

After pushing to git, deploy on server with:

```bash
ssh root@64.227.160.206
cd /opt/Slack2teams-2

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Update nginx
docker cp nginx.conf slack2teams-nginx-prod:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
docker exec slack2teams-nginx-prod nginx -t
docker exec slack2teams-nginx-prod nginx -s reload

# Rebuild and restart backend
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build backend
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml stop backend
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d backend
```

## Expected Results

- ✅ No `ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` in browser console
- ✅ Full response displays on screen
- ✅ Responses stream in real-time
- ✅ Multiple messages work without issues

## Technical Details

The issue was caused by:
1. nginx buffering SSE streams with HTTP/2
2. Immediate stream closure without flushing buffers
3. Wrong chunked encoding setting for SSE
4. Missing CORS headers

The fix ensures:
1. nginx passes stream through immediately
2. HTTP/2 has time to flush all data before closure
3. Proper chunked encoding for SSE
4. Complete CORS support
