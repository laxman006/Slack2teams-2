    "status": "PASS",
    "verdict": "SUCCESS - Provided answer",
    "answer": "CloudFuze offers a **requirements-based pricing model** that allows businesses to pay only for the migration tool when necessary. This model provides several advantages:\n\n1. **Cost Efficiency**: Organizations can accurately estimate their migration needs and budget, avoiding unnecessary expenses associated with annual licensing.\n\n2. **No Long-Term Commitment**: Businesses are not locked into long-term contracts, allowing for flexibility and eliminating concerns about being tied to an annual license that may not align with their migration timelines.\n\n3. **Maximized ROI**: By paying only for the services they use, businesses can maximize their return on investment (ROI) and ensure they get the most value from their migration budget.\n\nThis flexible pricing structure is designed to cater to businesses of all sizes, enabling them to tailor their migration strategy to their unique requirements without the constraints of traditional licensing models. \n\nFor more details on how this pricing model works, you can check out the blog post on [migrating Box to Microsoft 365 without annual licensing](https://www.cloudfuze.com/migrate-box-to-microsoft-365-without-annual-licensing/). \n\nIf you have further questions or need assistance, feel free to [contact CloudFuze](https://www.cloudfuze.com/contact/).",

    "question": "How does delta migration work in CloudFuze?",
    "status": "PASS",
    "verdict": "SUCCESS - Provided answer",
    "answer": "Delta migration in CloudFuze is designed to ensure that businesses can continue working on their source cloud while data is being migrated, allowing for zero downtime during the migration process. Here’s how it works:\n\n### Overview of Delta Migration\n- **Incremental Changes**: Delta migration, also known as incremental migration, occurs after the initial one-time migration is completed. It focuses on migrating only the updates and changes made to the source cloud during the one-time migration period. This includes new files added, modifications to existing files, or deletions.\n\n### The Process\n1. **Initial Migration**: The process begins with a one-time migration where all the data is transferred from the source cloud to the destination cloud.\n2. **Scheduling Delta Migration**: Once the one-time migration is complete, CloudFuze schedules a delta migration, typically on weekends, to minimize disruption to users.\n3. **Migration of Changes**: During delta migration, only the changes that occurred after the initial migration are transferred. This ensures that the destination cloud is up to date with the latest data from the source cloud.\n\n### Benefits of Delta Migration\n- **Time Efficiency**: Since delta migration only involves transferring updates rather than the entire dataset, it generally takes less time compared to the initial migration.\n- **Cost-Effective**: Delta migration is included as a core feature for all CloudFuze customers, making it a cost-effective solution for ongoing data synchronization.\n- **Zero Downtime**: Users can continue to work on their files in the source cloud without interruption, as delta migration ensures that all incremental changes are captured and migrated.\n\n### What Gets Migrated\n- New files added to the source cloud.\n- Modifications or deletions of existing files.\n- Any other updates that occurred during the one-time migration.\n\n### Conclusion\nCloudFuze’s delta migration feature is crucial for businesses that need to ensure their data is always current and that no critical information is lost during the migration process. By focusing on incremental changes, CloudFuze provides a seamless and efficient migration experience.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can read the full blog post on [Delta Migration: How CloudFuze Ensures Zero Downtime During Migration](https://www.cloudfuze.com/delta-migration-how-cloudfuze-ensures-zero-downtime-during-migration/).

    "question": "What happens to file version history during Box to OneDrive migration?",
    "status": "PASS",
    "verdict": "SUCCESS - Provided answer",
    "answer": "During the migration from Box to OneDrive, preserving file version history is crucial, as it allows users to access and restore previous iterations of files. However, there are specific challenges associated with this process:\n\n1. **Doubling of Versions**: When migrating file versions along with their timestamps, each version's duplicate is created in OneDrive. This means that if a file has multiple versions, the total storage required in OneDrive will increase significantly, potentially leading to higher costs due to the extra data size.\n\n2. **Migration Options**: CloudFuze provides flexibility in migrating file versions. Users can choose to migrate all versions, selective versions (e.g., the latest 5, 10, or 20 versions), or none at all. This customization helps organizations manage their storage needs effectively.\n\n3. **Metadata Preservation**: Along with version history, CloudFuze ensures that other metadata, such as timestamps and sharing permissions, are retained during the migration. This is essential for maintaining compliance and collaboration workflows.\n\n4. **Challenges with Native Tools**: Native Microsoft options do not support maintaining version history during the migration process. Therefore, using a dedicated migration tool like CloudFuze is recommended to avoid issues such as loss of metadata, broken sharing permissions, and skipped files.\n\nIn summary, while migrating from Box to OneDrive, it is essential to use a reliable migration tool like CloudFuze to ensure that file version history is preserved effectively, along with other critical metadata.

    "question": "How does CloudFuze handle permission mapping during migration?",
    "status": "PASS",
    "verdict": "SUCCESS - Provided answer",
    "answer": "CloudFuze offers several methods for handling permission mapping during migration, ensuring that user permissions are accurately transferred between source and destination cloud environments. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. **Auto-Mapping**: CloudFuze automatically maps users based on their email addresses. If the usernames in the source and destination clouds match, they are paired for migration. This method is the easiest and most efficient way to handle user mapping.\n\n2. **Manual Mapping**: In cases where auto-mapping does not work (e.g., mismatched usernames), CloudFuze allows for manual mapping. This option gives users the flexibility to specify how users should be paired between the two environments.\n\n3. **CSV Mapping**: For larger migrations or when there are significant discrepancies in user accounts, CloudFuze supports CSV mapping. This method allows users to upload a CSV file that details how users in the source cloud correspond to users in the destination cloud, facilitating accurate permission mapping.\n\n4. **Customization of Permissions Mapping**: During the migration process, businesses have the option to customize permissions mapping if needed. This feature is particularly useful for organizations that require specific configurations for user access and permissions.\n\n5. **Comprehensive Permissions Migration**: CloudFuze ensures that all levels of permissions are preserved during migration, including root folder permissions, sub-folder permissions, and file-level permissions. This capability is crucial for maintaining the integrity of access controls in the new environment.\n\n6. **Real-Time Monitoring and Reporting**: After the migration, users can monitor the progress and check migration reports to ensure that permissions have been accurately transferred.\n\nBy utilizing these methods, CloudFuze effectively manages permission mapping, helping organizations transition smoothly between cloud services while retaining necessary access controls.
