    "question": "How does CloudFuze handle permission mapping when migrating shared folders from Google Drive to OneDrive with external collaborators?",
    "responses": [
      "CloudFuze effectively manages permission mapping during the migration of shared folders from Google Drive to OneDrive, particularly for external collaborators. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. **Mapping User Roles**: CloudFuze ensures that the permissions associated with shared folders in Google Drive are accurately mapped to the corresponding user roles in OneDrive. This is crucial because Google Drive and OneDrive have different permission structures.\n\n2. **Preserving External Shares**: When migrating shared folders, CloudFuze retains the external sharing permissions, allowing external collaborators to maintain their access levels. This prevents any disruption in collaboration and ensures that external users can still access the shared content post-migration.\n\n3. **Automated User Mapping**: The platform automatically maps users based on their email addresses. If there are discrepancies in email addresses between the source and destination, CloudFuze allows for customization through CSV mapping to ensure that permissions are correctly assigned.\n\n4. **Comprehensive Migration Features**: In addition to permissions, CloudFuze also migrates other important metadata such as timestamps, versions, and shared links, ensuring a complete and seamless transition of shared folders.\n\n5. **Validation Post-Migration**: After the migration, users can verify that the permissions have been correctly applied in OneDrive, ensuring that external collaborators retain the same access they had in Google Drive.\n\nBy following these steps, CloudFuze simplifies the migration process and helps organizations maintain collaboration with external partners without the need for manual re-sharing of files. For more details, you can refer to the blog post on [how to migrate from Google Drive to OneDrive](https://www.cloudfuze.com/migrate-from-google-drive-to-onedrive/). \n\nIf you have further questions or need assistance, feel free to [contact CloudFuze](https://www.cloudfuze.com/contact/).",

    "question": "What happens to file version history during a Box to OneDrive migration?",
    "responses": [
      "During a Box to OneDrive migration, the preservation of file version history is a critical aspect. CloudFuze ensures that all versions of files can be migrated, maintaining the integrity of the version history. Here are the key points regarding file version history during this migration:\n\n- **Version History Retention**: CloudFuze allows for the migration of all or selective versions of files. This means you can choose to migrate the latest versions or all versions, depending on your business needs.\n\n- **Doubling of Versions**: It's important to note that when migrating file versions along with their timestamps, the size of the data in OneDrive will effectively double. For example, if a file has multiple versions, each version will be stored separately in OneDrive, which can lead to increased storage requirements.\n\n- **Metadata Preservation**: Along with the version history, CloudFuze also preserves metadata such as timestamps and sharing permissions, ensuring that all relevant information is retained during the migration process.\n\n- **Challenges with Native Tools**: There are no native Microsoft options for maintaining version history when migrating from Box to OneDrive. Manual methods or basic sync tools may result in loss of metadata, making a reliable migration tool like CloudFuze essential for preserving version history.\n\nFor more detailed information on this process, you can refer to the [Box to OneDrive Migration Guide](https://www.cloudfuze.com/how-to-transfer-files-from-box-to-onedrive/).

This ensures that the integrity of the files and their collaborative context is maintained post-migration.\n\n- **Increased Storage Requirements**: It’s important to note that migrating all versions will double the storage space required in OneDrive, as each version will be stored separately. For example, if a file has 5 versions, it will take up space equivalent to 10 versions in OneDrive.\n\n- **Challenges with Native Tools**: There are no native Microsoft options for maintaining version history during a Box to OneDrive migration, which is why using a dedicated migration tool like CloudFuze is recommended to avoid loss of metadata and ensure a seamless transition.\n\nFor more detailed information on this process, you can refer to the [Box to OneDrive Migration Guide](https://www.cloudfuze.com/how-to-transfer-files-from-box-to-onedrive/).

    "question": "How does delta migration work in CloudFuze and what technology does it use?",
    "responses": [
      "Delta migration in CloudFuze is designed to ensure that only the incremental changes made to the source cloud during the initial one-time migration are transferred to the destination cloud. This process allows businesses to continue working on their source cloud while the migration is ongoing, ensuring zero downtime.\n\n### How Delta Migration Works:\n1. **Initial Migration**: Delta migration comes into play after the one-time migration is completed. Once this initial migration is done, CloudFuze schedules a delta migration, typically on a weekend, to capture any changes made during the initial migration period.\n   \n2. **Incremental Changes**: During delta migration, only the updates and changes—such as new files added, modifications made, or deletions—are migrated. This means that businesses do not have to re-migrate the entire dataset, which saves time and resources.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: Since delta migration only involves transferring the changes, it generally takes less time compared to the one-time migration. The duration depends on the number of users and the extent of changes made during the initial migration.\n\n### Technology Used:\nCloudFuze employs advanced technologies to facilitate delta migration, including:\n- **REST API**: This technology allows for efficient data transfer and synchronization between the source and destination clouds.\n- **Real-Time Monitoring**: CloudFuze provides real-time monitoring of the migration process, enabling quick identification and resolution of any issues that may arise.\n\nBy leveraging these technologies, CloudFuze ensures a secure, efficient, and disruption-free migration experience for businesses.\n\nFor more detailed insights, you can read about [CloudFuze's delta migration capabilities](https://www.cloudfuze.com/delta-migration-how-cloudfuze-ensures-zero-downtime-during-migration/).

In Slack, conversations can be rapid and informal, often using threads for context.

      "Based on the information available, migrating from Slack Enterprise Grid with multiple workspaces to a single Microsoft Teams tenant is feasible.
