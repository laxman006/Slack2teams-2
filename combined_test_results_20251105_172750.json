    "question": "How does CloudFuze handle permission mapping when migrating shared folders from Google Drive to OneDrive with external collaborators?",
    "category": "Technical Migration",
    "responses": [
      "CloudFuze effectively manages permission mapping during the migration of shared folders from Google Drive to OneDrive, particularly for external collaborators. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. **Mapping User Roles**: CloudFuze ensures that the sharing permissions from Google Drive are accurately mapped to the corresponding user roles in OneDrive. This is crucial because Google Drive and OneDrive have different permission structures. For instance, permissions like \"Content Manager\" in Google Drive may be mapped to \"Edit\" in OneDrive.\n\n2. **Preserving External Shares**: When migrating shared folders, CloudFuze retains the external sharing permissions, ensuring that external collaborators maintain their access levels post-migration. This prevents any disruption in collaboration and ensures that external users can still access the shared content in OneDrive as they did in Google Drive.\n\n3. **Automated Permissions Migration**: The CloudFuze migration tool automates the process of migrating permissions, which includes internal and external sharing settings. This automation reduces the risk of errors that can occur with manual permission assignments.\n\n4. **Customization Options**: If there are differences in user email addresses between the source and destination clouds, CloudFuze allows for customization through CSV mapping. This feature enables users to specify how permissions should be assigned, ensuring that all collaborators retain their intended access.\n\n5. **Real-Time Monitoring**: During the migration process, CloudFuze provides real-time monitoring, allowing users to track the status of the migration and verify that permissions have been correctly applied.\n\nBy following these steps, CloudFuze ensures a seamless transition of shared folders from Google Drive to OneDrive while maintaining the integrity of external sharing permissions. For more detailed information, you can refer to the [migration guide](https://www.cloudfuze.com/migrate-from-google-drive-to-onedrive/) provided by CloudFuze. \n\nIf you have further questions or need assistance, feel free to [contact CloudFuze](https://www.cloudfuze.com/contact/).",

    "question": "What happens to file version history during a Box to OneDrive migration?",
    "category": "Technical Migration",
    "responses": [
      "During a Box to OneDrive migration, the preservation of file version history is a critical aspect. CloudFuze's migration tool ensures that all versions of files are maintained throughout the transfer process. Here’s what happens:\n\n- **Before Migration**: The original file in Box may have multiple versions saved, complete with timestamps and \"Modified By\" metadata.\n- **After Migration**: CloudFuze successfully migrates all selected versions to OneDrive, retaining the complete version history, current timestamps, and modified by information. This means that if a file had, for example, 10 versions in Box, all 10 versions will remain intact in OneDrive after the migration.\n\nThis capability is essential for businesses, especially during mergers, acquisitions, or rebranding, as it allows them to track changes, restore previous versions, and comply with audit requirements. Without a reliable migration tool like CloudFuze, there is a risk of losing version history, which can impede operations and lower accountability.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can check out the blog post on [OneDrive Tenant To Tenant Migration with All Versions Intact](https://www.cloudfuze.com/onedrive-tenant-to-tenant-migration/). \n\nIf you're considering a migration, feel free to [contact CloudFuze](https://www.cloudfuze.com/contact/) for a free demo!",
      "During a Box to OneDrive migration, the preservation of file version history is a critical aspect. CloudFuze's migration tool ensures that all versions of files can be migrated, maintaining the integrity of version history throughout the process. \n\nHere are the key points regarding file version history during the migration:\n\n- **Version History Retention**: CloudFuze allows for the migration of all or selective versions of files. This means you can choose to migrate the latest versions or all versions, depending on your business needs. \n\n- **Doubling of Versions**: It's important to note that when migrating file versions along with their timestamps, each version will double in size in OneDrive. For example, if a file has multiple versions, the total storage required in OneDrive will increase accordingly.\n\n- **Metadata Preservation**: Along with version history, CloudFuze also preserves metadata such as timestamps and sharing permissions, ensuring that all relevant information is retained during the migration.\n\n- **Challenges with Native Tools**: There are no native Microsoft options for maintaining version history when migrating from Box to OneDrive, which is why using a dedicated migration tool like CloudFuze is essential to avoid loss of metadata and version history.\n\nFor more detailed information on this process, you can refer to the [Box to OneDrive Migration Guide](https://www.cloudfuze.com/how-to-transfer-files-from-box-to-onedrive/). \n\nIf you're considering a migration, feel free to [contact CloudFuze](https://www.cloudfuze.com/contact/) for a free demo or further assistance!",

For example, if a file has 10 versions, it will take up double the space in OneDrive compared to the original Box storage.\n\nOverall, CloudFuze effectively maintains the entire version history during the migration, which is essential for compliance, collaboration, and tracking changes.

    "question": "What happens to Slack threaded conversations during Teams migration?",
    "category": "Slack to Teams",
    "responses": [
      "During the migration from Slack to Microsoft Teams, it's important to understand how threaded conversations are handled. In Slack, conversations can be rapid and informal, often using threads for context. However, in Microsoft Teams, channels are structured for organized and long-term discussions, and threading replies are encouraged to maintain context.\n\nWhen migrating, CloudFuze ensures that message threads from Slack are accurately replicated in Teams. This means that while the structure of conversations may change, the context and continuity of discussions are preserved. Users are encouraged to adapt to the threading feature in Teams, which helps maintain the flow of conversations similar to what they experienced in Slack.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to avoid using Microsoft Teams during the migration process. Using Teams while the migration is in progress can interrupt the flow of direct messages and threads, potentially leading to confusion and data merging issues. Therefore, it is recommended to complete the migration before fully transitioning to Teams to ensure a smooth experience.\n\nFor more detailed insights on migrating threaded conversations, you can refer to the [Slack to Teams Migration Guide for IT Admins](https://www.cloudfuze.com/slack-to-teams-migration-guide-for-it-admins/). If you have further questions or need assistance, feel free to [contact CloudFuze](https://www.cloudfuze.com/contact/).",

      "During the migration from Slack to Microsoft Teams, it's important to understand how threaded conversations are handled. In Slack, conversations can be rapid and informal, often occurring in a flat structure without the use of threads. In contrast, Microsoft Teams encourages a more organized approach, utilizing threads to maintain context for long-term discussions.\n\nWhen migrating, CloudFuze ensures that the structure of conversations is preserved as much as possible. However, since Microsoft Teams uses a different method for organizing conversations, users may need to adapt to the threading system in Teams. This means that while the content of the conversations will be migrated, the way they are organized may change, requiring users to get comfortable with replying within threads to maintain context.\n\nAdditionally, if users continue to use Slack during the migration, it can complicate the process, especially for direct messages (DMs), as the flow of replication can be interrupted. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid using Teams during the migration to ensure a smooth transition and to prevent any confusion or data merging issues.\n\nFor more detailed insights on migrating from Slack to Teams, you can refer to the [Slack to Teams Migration Guide for IT Admins](https://www.cloudfuze.com/slack-to-teams-migration-guide-for-it-admins/).

Additionally, CloudFuze's flexible licensing models, including annual licenses, help MSPs streamline their operations and reduce the complexity associated with multiple licensing agreements.\n\nFor more detailed information on pricing and to explore how CloudFuze can support your specific migration needs, you can check out the [MSP Pricing for Cloud Data Migrations from CloudFuze](https://www.cloudfuze.com/msp-pricing-for-cloud-data-migrations-from-cloudfuze/). \n\nIf you have further questions or need a customized quote, feel free to [contact CloudFuze](https://www.cloudfuze.com/contact/).",
      "Yes, CloudFuze offers enterprise pricing with volume discounts for migrations over 1TB. The pricing structure is designed to be strategic, allowing Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to benefit from significant discounts based on the volume of data being migrated. This is part of the dedicated MSP Partner Program, which provides attractive pricing options for MSPs of all sizes, enabling them to introduce their service costs while maintaining a profitable margin.\n\nFor example, if a migration project involves a large volume of data, such as a Dropbox to Google Drive migration, MSPs can receive substantial discounts that can be passed on to their customers, making it a win-win situation for both parties.
