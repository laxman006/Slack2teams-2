# Automated SharePoint Extraction - Final Solution

## The Reality

**Microsoft Graph API CANNOT retrieve SharePoint page content.** 
It only returns metadata (titles, IDs, etc.), not the actual page HTML/content.

## Why Test Document Worked

The `SharePoint_Test_Content.docx` was created with **manual data** that I typed in, not fetched from SharePoint. I copied the content from your screenshots.

## The Only True Automated Solution: Browser Automation

To truly automate SharePoint extraction, we need:

### **Option A: Selenium WebDriver (Recommended)**

**Requirements:**
1. Install Selenium: `pip install selenium`
2. Download ChromeDriver
3. You authenticate in the browser once
4. Script opens SharePoint pages and extracts content

**Pros:**
- Fully automated
- Gets actual page content
- Works with your authentication
- Can extract all pages automatically

**Cons:**
- Requires browser automation setup
- May be slower than API calls
- Need to handle authentication flow

### **Option B: MSAL with Delegated Permissions** 

**Requirements:**
1. Add delegated permissions (not application permissions)
2. Use interactive authentication (you login once)
3. Then can access SharePoint pages like a user would

**Pros:**
- No browser automation needed
- Uses Microsoft authentication properly
- Access pages like a regular user

**Cons:**
- Requires user login/consent
- More complex token handling

## My Recommendation

### **Best Approach: Simplified Manual Export**

Since automated extraction is complex, here's the fastest path:

1. **Export SharePoint content to Word/Excel files** (takes 15 minutes)
2. **Place files in a directory** (e.g., `sharepoint_content/`)
3. **The system automatically processes them** 
4. **Re-export when content changes** (update as needed)

This gives you:
- ✅ Full control over what's included
- ✅ No authentication complexity  
- ✅ Updates when you want
- ✅ Simple and reliable

Would you like me to:
1. **Set up the manual import process** (fastest, 15 minutes total)
2. **Implement Selenium browser automation** (complex, 2-3 hours)
3. **Try MSAL interactive authentication** (moderate complexity, 1 hour)
