    "question": "How does delta migration work in CloudFuze?",
    "status": "PASS",
    "verdict": "SUCCESS - Provided answer",
    "answer": "Delta migration in CloudFuze is designed to ensure that data remains up-to-date during the migration process, allowing users to continue working on their source cloud while changes are being migrated. Here’s how it works:\n\n### Overview of Delta Migration\n- **Incremental Changes**: Delta migration, also known as incremental migration, occurs after the initial one-time migration is completed. It focuses on migrating only the updates and changes made to the source cloud during the period following the one-time migration.\n- **Types of Changes Migrated**: This includes new files added, modifications made, or deletions of existing files in the source cloud.\n\n### Process of Delta Migration\n1. **Initial Migration**: The process begins with a one-time migration where all data is transferred from the source cloud to the destination cloud.\n2. **Scheduling Delta Migration**: After the one-time migration, CloudFuze schedules the delta migration, typically on weekends, to minimize disruption to users.\n3. **Migration of Updates**: During delta migration, only the changes that occurred after the initial migration are transferred. This ensures that the destination cloud reflects the most current state of the source cloud without needing to re-transfer all data.\n\n### Benefits of Delta Migration\n- **Zero Downtime**: Users can continue to work on their files in the source cloud without experiencing downtime during the migration process.\n- **Efficiency**: Since delta migration only transfers updates, it generally takes less time compared to the initial migration, making it a faster and more efficient process.\n- **Cost-Effective**: Delta migration is included as a core feature for all CloudFuze customers, allowing businesses to manage their migration needs without incurring additional costs.\n\n### Conclusion\nCloudFuze’s delta migration feature is essential for ensuring that all incremental changes are captured and migrated, providing a seamless transition to the new cloud environment. For more detailed information, you can read the full blog post on [Delta Migration: How CloudFuze Ensures Zero Downtime During Migration](https://www.cloudfuze.com/delta-migration-how-cloudfuze-ensures-zero-downtime-during-migration/). \n\nIf you have further questions or need assistance with your migration, feel free to [contact CloudFuze](https://www.cloudfuze.com/contact/).",

    "question": "What happens to file version history during Box to OneDrive migration?",
    "status": "PASS",
    "verdict": "SUCCESS - Provided answer",
    "answer": "During the migration from Box to OneDrive, preserving file version history is crucial for maintaining accountability and compliance. CloudFuze's migration tool ensures that all or selective versions of files are retained during the transfer. \n\nHere are the key points regarding file version history during the migration:\n\n- **Version History Preservation**: CloudFuze allows businesses to migrate either all versions or a selected number of versions (e.g., 5, 10, 20, or all versions) of a file from Box to OneDrive. This flexibility helps organizations maintain the necessary historical data for reference and compliance.\n\n- **Metadata and Timestamps**: Along with version history, CloudFuze also preserves important metadata, including timestamps and sharing permissions, ensuring that the integrity of the files is maintained throughout the migration process.\n\n- **Challenges with Manual Methods**: Traditional manual migration methods do not support the preservation of version history, which can lead to loss of metadata and broken sharing permissions. CloudFuze addresses these challenges by providing a robust migration solution that retains all necessary file features.\n\n- **Increased Storage Requirements**: It's important to note that migrating file versions can double the storage space required in OneDrive, as each version will be stored separately. Organizations should plan for this additional storage requirement during the migration process.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [Box to OneDrive Migration Guide for IT Admins](https://www.cloudfuze.com/how-to-transfer-files-from-box-to-onedrive/). \n\nIf you have further questions or need assistance, feel free to [contact CloudFuze](https://www.cloudfuze.com/contact/).",

    "question": "How long does a typical migration take?",
    "status": "PASS",
    "verdict": "SUCCESS - Provided answer",
    "answer": "The duration of a migration project can vary significantly based on several factors, including:\n\n- **Number of users being migrated**\n- **Number of items being migrated**\n- **Size of the items being migrated**\n\nDepending on these factors, migration can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. Additionally, network speed and the limitations of the destination cloud can also impact the migration's progress. \n\nFor example, when migrating from Microsoft 365 to Google Workspace, larger files will take longer to transfer, while faster internet speeds can enhance migration speed. CloudFuze's high-speed data migration solution can facilitate the migration of terabytes and petabytes of data within the shortest possible timeframe, and it includes features like delta migration to preserve any new or changed data after the initial transfer, which can save time and effort.\n\nIf you're looking for more specific timelines tailored to your migration needs, it's advisable to consult with CloudFuze's migration specialists who can provide a more accurate estimate based on your unique requirements. \n\nFor further details, you can check out the blog post on [Transfer to Google Workspace from Microsoft 365: Top 6 FAQs](https://www.cloudfuze.com/transfer-to-google-workspace-from-microsoft-365/).",

    "question": "How does CloudFuze handle permission mapping during migration?",
    "status": "PASS",
    "verdict": "SUCCESS - Provided answer",
    "answer": "CloudFuze handles permission mapping during migration through a structured process that includes several key features:\n\n1. **User Mapping Options**: CloudFuze provides three methods for mapping users:\n   - **Auto-mapping**: This is the easiest method where CloudFuze compares usernames between the source and destination clouds. If the usernames match, they are paired for migration.\n   - **Manual Mapping**: This option allows users to manually select and map users if auto-mapping is not applicable.\n   - **CSV Mapping**: Users can upload a CSV file to define user mappings, which is particularly useful when usernames differ across tenants.\n\n2. **Permissions Mapping Stage**: During the migration process, CloudFuze includes a dedicated stage for permissions mapping. This allows businesses to customize how permissions are assigned to users in the destination cloud. Users can review and control access levels to ensure that the intended permissions are maintained post-migration.\n\n3. **Preservation of Permissions**: CloudFuze ensures that all types of permissions, including root and nested folder/file permissions, are preserved during the migration. This includes internal and external sharing settings, ensuring that users retain the same access controls in the target environment.\n\n4. **Handling Mismatched Pairs**: If there are users in the source cloud that do not have corresponding users in the destination cloud (or vice versa), CloudFuze will not include these users in the auto-map list. In such cases, CSV mapping can be utilized to handle these discrepancies.\n\n5. **Finalization and Monitoring**: After mapping users and permissions, users can preview all migration parameters before starting the migration. CloudFuze also provides real-time monitoring of the migration progress and allows users to download migration reports for auditing purposes.\n\nBy leveraging these features, CloudFuze facilitates a seamless and accurate migration of permissions, ensuring that collaboration and access controls remain intact throughout the process.
