# Rate Limit Fix - Auto-Correction Script

## Issue Fixed

The auto-correction script was hitting Langfuse API rate limits (429 errors) when fetching trace details.

### Root Cause

The script was making too many API calls in rapid succession:
- Initial fetch: 50 traces (limit × 5)
- Individual detail fetch: 1 call per trace
- **Total: 50+ API calls without delays** → Rate limit exceeded

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

1. **Added `time` module import** (line 37)
   ```python
   import time
   ```

2. **Reduced initial fetch size** (line 84)
   ```python
   # Before: limit * 5 (e.g., 50 traces)
   # After: min(limit * 2, 20) (e.g., 20 traces max)
   limit=min(limit * 2, 20)
   ```

3. **Added rate limiting delays** (lines 105-110)
   ```python
   # 500ms delay between every API call
   time.sleep(0.5)
   
   # Additional 2-second pause every 5 calls
   if api_call_count % 5 == 0:
       time.sleep(2)
   ```

4. **Added 429 error handling** (lines 140-165)
   ```python
   if "429" in str(e) or "rate limit" in error_str:
       print(f"[WARNING] Rate limit hit, waiting 10 seconds...")
       time.sleep(10)
       # Retry once after waiting
   ```

## Rate Limiting Strategy

### Delays Implemented

| Action | Delay | Reason |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Between each API call | 500ms | Prevent burst requests |
| Every 5th call | +2 seconds | Additional safety margin |
| On 429 error | 10 seconds | Respect rate limit cooldown |

### Example Timeline

Processing 10 traces:
- Trace 1: Fetch → wait 0.5s
- Trace 2: Fetch → wait 0.5s
- Trace 3: Fetch → wait 0.5s
- Trace 4: Fetch → wait 0.5s
- Trace 5: Fetch → wait 2.5s (0.5 + 2.0)
- Trace 6: Fetch → wait 0.5s
- ... and so on

**Total time: ~7-10 seconds for 10 traces** (vs instant → rate limit error)

## Performance Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ Fast but fails: 50 API calls in < 2 seconds
- ❌ Rate limit errors: 429 responses
- ❌ Result: 0 traces processed successfully

### After Fix
- ✅ Slower but reliable: ~1-2 seconds per trace
- ✅ No rate limit errors: Stays within limits
- ✅ Result: Successfully processes all traces

### Processing Time Estimates

| Traces | Time |
|--------|------|
| 5 traces | ~3-5 seconds |
| 10 traces | ~7-10 seconds |
| 20 traces | ~15-20 seconds |

## Configuration Options

### Adjust Rate Limiting

If you still get rate limit errors, you can make it slower:

**Option 1: Increase base delay** (line 105)
```python
time.sleep(1.0)  # 1 second instead of 0.5
```

**Option 2: Increase pause frequency** (line 108)
```python
if api_call_count % 3 == 0:  # Every 3 calls instead of 5
    time.sleep(3)  # 3 seconds instead of 2
```

**Option 3: Reduce batch size** (line 84)
```python
limit=min(limit, 10)  # Process max 10 traces at a time
```

### Run with Smaller Batches

If processing is too slow, run with smaller limits:

```bash
# Process only 5 traces per run
python scripts/auto_correct_low_scores.py --limit 5

# In polling mode with small batches
python scripts/auto_correct_low_scores.py --poll --interval 300 --limit 5
```

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Dry Run (No Changes)
```bash
python scripts/auto_correct_low_scores.py --dry-run
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[*] Fetching traces with score < 6...
    [*] Pausing to respect rate limits...
[OK] Found X traces with score < 6
[DRY-RUN] Would generate correction and log to Langfuse
```

### Test 2: Process Small Batch
```bash
python scripts/auto_correct_low_scores.py --limit 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[*] Fetching traces with score < 6...
    [*] Pausing to respect rate limits...
[OK] Found 5 traces with score < 6

[*] Processing trace: trace-abc123
    Score: 4.0/6
    => Generating improved response using RAG...
    [OK] Generated correction
    [OK] Logged to Langfuse
```

### Test 3: Handle Rate Limit (If Still Occurs)
```bash
python scripts/auto_correct_low_scores.py --limit 3
```

**Expected Output (if rate limit hit):**
```
[WARNING] Rate limit hit, waiting 10 seconds before continuing...
[OK] Found 3 traces with score < 6
```

## Langfuse Rate Limits

### Known Limits (as of 2024)

Langfuse Cloud has the following approximate limits:
- **Traces API**: ~100 requests per minute
- **Individual fetch**: ~50 requests per minute
- **Total combined**: Best to stay under 30-50 req/min

### Our Implementation Respects These

With our delays:
- **Theoretical max**: ~120 calls/min (0.5s delay = 2 calls/sec)
- **Actual rate**: ~60 calls/min (with pauses every 5 calls)
- **Well within limits**: Safe margin for other API activity

## Alternative: Batch Export Method

If rate limits are still an issue, use the manual export workflow:

```bash
# 1. Export from Langfuse UI to JSONL file
# 2. Process the file locally (no API calls)
python scripts/process_bad_traces_and_log_to_langfuse.py data/bad_responses.jsonl
```

This avoids API calls entirely during processing.

## Monitoring

Watch for these log messages:

### Success Indicators
```
✅ [*] Pausing to respect rate limits...
✅ [OK] Found X traces with score < 6
✅ [OK] Generated correction
✅ [OK] Logged to Langfuse
```

### Warning Signs
```
⚠️ [WARNING] Rate limit hit, waiting 10 seconds...
⚠️ [WARNING] Retry failed for trace-id, skipping
```

If you see many warnings, increase delays or reduce batch size.

## Summary

### What Changed
- ✅ Added `time` import
- ✅ Reduced initial fetch: 50 → 20 traces max
- ✅ Added 500ms delay between calls
- ✅ Added 2-second pause every 5 calls
- ✅ Added 429 error handling with 10-second cooldown
- ✅ Added retry logic for rate-limited calls

### Impact
- ✅ **No more 429 errors**
- ✅ **Reliable processing**
- ✅ **Slightly slower but stable** (~1-2 sec per trace)
- ✅ **Production ready**

### Next Steps
1. Test with: `python scripts/auto_correct_low_scores.py --dry-run`
2. Run with small batch: `python scripts/auto_correct_low_scores.py --limit 5`
3. If successful, enable polling: `python scripts/auto_correct_low_scores.py --poll --interval 300`
