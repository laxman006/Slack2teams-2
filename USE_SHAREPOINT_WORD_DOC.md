# Using the SharePoint Word Document for Knowledge Base

## âœ… What You Have

You already have `SharePoint_Test_Content.docx` which contains sample SharePoint content. Let's use this!

## ðŸš€ Quick Path to Add SharePoint Content

### **Step 1: Convert Word Doc to Text**

The easiest way to get SharePoint content into your vectorstore:

```bash
# Convert Word doc to text (requires python-docx which is already installed)
python -c "
from docx import Document
doc = Document('SharePoint_Test_Content.docx')
text = '\n'.join([para.text for para in doc.paragraphs])
print(text)
" > sharepoint_content.txt
```

### **Step 2: Add More Content**

Create additional text files with SharePoint content:
- `sharepoint_content/FAQ_Slack_to_Teams.txt`
- `sharepoint_content/FAQ_Slack_to_Google_Chat.txt`
- `sharepoint_content/Egnyte_Combinations.txt`
- etc.

### **Step 3: Enable and Process**

In your `.env`:
```bash
ENABLE_SHAREPOINT_SOURCE=false  # Disable for now
# Instead, use a file-based approach
```

Or create a simple importer that reads these files.

## ðŸ’¡ Recommended: Create a Simpler Import System

Instead of fighting with SharePoint APIs, let's create:

1. **A text files directory** (e.g., `sharepoint_export/`)
2. **A simple processor** that reads all `.txt` files from that directory
3. **Adds them to vectorstore** automatically

This way you can:
- Export SharePoint pages manually
- Save as text files
- Run: `python manage_vectorstore.py --add-sharepoint-files`
- Done! Content added to vectorstore

Would you like me to:
1. **Set up this file-based import system**? (10 minutes)
2. **Continue trying Selenium**? (more complex)
3. **Help you export SharePoint content** to files?
