# SharePoint Content Manual Import Guide

## Current Situation

✅ **Working:**
- SharePoint authentication
- Site connection
- Page listing (found 3 pages)
- Integration framework ready

❌ **Not Working:**
- Automatic content extraction from SharePoint pages (Microsoft Graph API limitation)

## Solution: Manual Content Import

### Option 1: Copy-Paste Method (Fastest)

1. **Go to SharePoint**: https://cloudfuzecom.sharepoint.com/sites/DOC360

2. **Visit each important page**:
   - Multi User Golden Image Combinations (Main hub)
   - Each category page (18+ pages)
   - FAQ pages
   - All combination pages

3. **Copy the content** from each page (tables, FAQs, text)

4. **Create text files** in a new directory (e.g., `sharepoint_export/`)

5. **Add to your project** for automatic processing

### Option 2: Export and Import

1. **Export from SharePoint**:
   - Use SharePoint's "Export to Excel" for tables
   - Copy FAQs to text files
   - Save as structured documents

2. **Add to vectorstore**:
   - Place files in a folder (e.g., `sharepoint_content/`)
   - The system will automatically process them

### Option 3: Use the Test Document

The `SharePoint_Test_Content.docx` file I created contains:
- Sample FAQ content
- Compatibility table
- Source combinations list
- Expected statistics

You can use this as a template for manual extraction.

## Quick Start - Add Content Now

1. Create a text file: `sharepoint_content/slack_to_teams_faq.txt`
2. Copy your FAQ content from SharePoint
3. Save the file
4. Enable PDF source with this directory

The system will automatically process any text/PDF files you add to this directory.

## Expected Content to Extract

Based on your screenshots:

- **Main Hub**: Multi User Golden Image Combinations (18 links)
- **FAQs**: Slack to Teams, Slack to Google Chat, etc.
- **Tables**: Compatibility matrices for each service
- **Total**: ~100+ pages worth of content

## Next Steps

1. Choose your method (copy-paste, export, or manual file creation)
2. Add content files to a directory
3. Configure the system to process them
4. Rebuild vectorstore
